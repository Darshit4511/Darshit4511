## :computer:  Resume Builder Project

I have developed a web application for my college that allows students to enter their details and generate a pre-defined, fixed-format resume. The application simplifies the process of creating a professional resume by providing a user-friendly interface and automating the formatting tasks. I enjoyed building it to assist my fellow students with their resume preparation.

You can access the project [here](https://resume-builder-v1-ldce.netlify.app/).
